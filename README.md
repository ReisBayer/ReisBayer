Hi there and welcome to my profile.

My name is Christian but you can also call me Chris. Im 23, from Bavaria, germany and recently found my love for coding.
Im currently teaching myself Java and am excited for all the projects i'll be working on in the future.

I'm also glad to have some friends who are already coding for some years, so i got some firends i can always got to to ask questions when needed.

Some of my hobbies are coding, gaming, anime and singing.
I really love RPGs and strategy games. And it also really fascinates me how games work whats going on behind their surface.

I'll try to upload some of my little projects in the future.
